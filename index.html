    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <P>It's good to be here for another semester. 
        My name is Kseniya and I am based in Bellevue, 
        WA while originally being from Santa Cruz, CA. 
        I live with my lovely dog Kaia.
        I currently work two jobs - one full-time job 
        in-person, and my remote freelance work. I 
        graduated from undergraduate university at 
        Seattle U with degrees in psychology and 
        computer science in Spring of 2023. I hope 
        to utilize my skillset in research to be 
        an asset in the field of User Experience.</P>
